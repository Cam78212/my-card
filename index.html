      The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits around Earth at an average distance of 384,399 kilometres, about 30 times Earth's diameter,
      and completes an orbit every 29.5 days. This is the same length it takes the <strong>Moon</strong> to complete a rotation.

    <p>
      The Sun is the star at the centre of the Solar System. It is a massive, nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion 
      reactions in its core, radiating the energy from its surface mainly as visible light and infrared radiation with 10% at ultraviolet energies.

      Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being an ocean world, 
      the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water.

      Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. It is also known as the "Red Planet", because of its orange-red appearance. Mars is a

    <p>
      Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. It is a rocky planet with a trace 
      atmosphere and a surface gravity slightly higher than that of Mars.
